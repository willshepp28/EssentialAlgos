## Overview

EssentialAlgos is a curated collection of my personal approaches and solutions to popular coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeByte, and more. Each solution isn't just an answer, but a journey of problem-solving and critical thinking, laid out for clarity and deeper understanding.

## Purpose

- **Showcase**: This repository is a portfolio of my coding journey, detailing the thought processes, strategies, and solutions I've formulated for various coding challenges!
- **Share Knowledge**: By sharing my approaches, I hope to provide insights and potentially different angles to tackle these challenges.

## Platforms Covered

- **LeetCode**
- **HackerRank**
- **CodeByte**
- _...and more to come!_

## Testing

All solutions undergo rigorous testing to ensure their reliability and robustness. I use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a powerful JavaScript testing framework, for this purpose.
